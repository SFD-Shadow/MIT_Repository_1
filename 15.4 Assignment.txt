In my submission for this assignment, I have created all the necessary basic GUI that would be used in the game Entrepreneur to Industrialist.

     Starting in the top left of the screen, going down we have the day counter, which will change depending on how many days have passed in game.
Next there is the messages button which brings up the messages menu, this is where you will get alerts or messages about events happening in game.
After that we have the company info button which will summon its corresponding menu, this menu will show all of the stats about your company, from
order count, stocks, worker and customer hippieness, etc. Finally is the settings button that'll bring up the settings menu for tweaking the game's
properties.

     In the top right of the screen there is the company name that will be chosen by the player. The company's logo which will also be chosen by the player
from a list of premade logo's. And the current money count of the player's company.
