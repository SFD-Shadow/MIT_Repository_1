The following list is the list of inputs for the game "Entrepreneur to Industrialist"

1. Left mouse click / Screen finger tap / Controller bottom button ( A / X)

     These controls will be used as the primary source of interaction for the game, used for interacting with the world, UI, and overall interface.

2. Right mouse click drag / Screen finger drag / Controller right thumb stick

     This set of controls will be used for maneuvering the camera in game, allowing the player to pan the screen to look at different parts of the world.
For the mouse and touch screen controls, the screen will pan in the direction the player's mouse / finger moves towards. Where the controller thumb stick will
be used to pan the screen in the direction the thumbstick is facing on the controller.

3. Mouse wheel / Screen finger pinch and zoom / Controller D-Pad 

     These actions will be used for zooming in and out the camera. Moving the mouse wheel up will zoom in the camera, and mouse wheel down will zoom out. 
Pushing up on the D-pad for a controller will zoom the camera in, and pushing down will zoom in out. Using two fingers on a touch screen making the zoom gesture 
will cause the camera to zoom in, while doing a pinch gesture will make the camera zoom out.

4. Left controller thumbstick

     Since on other platforms like a computer or mobile, you can use your mouse position or the location of your finger to indicate where you want to make your
input, if the player is on controller they won't be able to do this. Which is why on controller the player can use their left thumb stick to manipulate a cursor 
on their screen.
